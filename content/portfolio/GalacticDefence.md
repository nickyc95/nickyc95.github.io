Given a base project containing a very simple barebones game, I had to improve it and extend it in any way that I chose.

For the competition I chose to create a space RTS, Tower defence style game. The project time scale was 2 weeks.

<b>I received the highest score in the second round out of all of the entrants, allowing me to progress to the final round.</b>

<b>Overall highest score in round 2!</b>

1 of 5 Finalists from all over Europe!
