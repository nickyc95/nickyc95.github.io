#### For Stadia

I worked primarilly on adding a Vulkan rendering backend to the then DirectX 11 engine.

I also provided additional support to the rest of the team in adding Linux platform support to the engine.

We chose to implement a custom rendering abstraction and worked closely with Hangar13 to ensure that the end product looked and performed as well as the Windows version.
