I supported the development team at Red Kite Games using knowledge about the proprietary engine, tools and technology in the Fusion Engine.

The technology behind the Mafia franchise had been built on for over 10 years, having done a lot of work on Mafia 3 Definitive edition I had a good understanding of how the technology worked and was able to support the team in implementing the desired features and bug fixes.
