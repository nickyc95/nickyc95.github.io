Languages: C++, GLSL
API: OpenGL 3.3

### Features:
- Phong Lighting Model
- Variance Shadow Mapping

- Normal Mapping
- Forward Renderer
 

This is a personal project that I am currently working on in my free time. The engine itself uses OpenGL 3.3 and as such uses the programmable pipeline utilizing GLSL.

The engine supports a few features however this is a work in progress, so features are being added all the time.
